# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.6.0 - 2019-08-10

### Added

- Implement support for SEP-0007 `pay` operation.
- Add the `cosmicLink.extra` property for SEP-0007 specific information:
  - `cosmicLink.extra.type` indicates the operation encoded into the
    SEP-0007 link (either `tx` or `pay`).
  - `cosmicLink.extra.pubkey` contains the tx operation `pubkey`, if any.
  - `cosmicLink.extra.msg` contains the parsed `msg`, if any. This is provided
    for compatibility purpose only. Displaying messages from untrusted sources
    into trusted interfaces opens hard to mitigate attack vectors & is
    discouraged.
- Add new method `cosmicLink.insertOperation(index, type, params)`.

### Fixed

- Set `cosmicLink.sep7` to input URL when parsing CosmicLink from SEP-0007 link.

## 1.5.5 - 2019-07-26

### Changed

- Automate release procedure.
- Add contributing guidelines.
- Update [stellar-sdk] to 2.1.1 (bugfixes).

## 1.5.4 - 2019-07-23

### Fixed

- Workaround a regression in [stellar-sdk] 2.0.1 that causes CallBuilder to
  fetch the wrong URL when several of them are created from the same Server
  instance. ([#379](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/issues/379)).

## 1.5.3 - 2019-07-20

### Changed

- Improve discoverability (add badges, keywords, set homepage...).

## 1.5.2 - 2019-07-19

### Changed

- Update [stellar-sdk] to 2.0.1.
- Switch to new cosmic.plus paths (cdn.cosmic.plus, new repository name).

## 1.5.1 - 2019-06-18

### Changed

- Update [stellar-sdk] to 1.0.3. (Get rid of a vulnerability in axios)

### Fixed

- Ignore SEP-0007 `msg` field as intended, instead of raising an error. This
  field is not supported by cosmic-lib because we don't want to display a
  message from untrusted sources into trusted interfaces, and because URL length
  is limited. Transaction request emitter should make sure the purpose of the
  transaction is clear before issuing a transaction request. - Thanks [@tyvdh]
- Decode the '+' character as a space for string parameters (text memo, network
  passphrase, text data in 'manageData' operation). - Thanks [@tyvdh]

## 1.5.0 - 2019-06-08

### Added

- Support for the new operation `manageBuyOffer`.
- New operations `manageSellOffer` & `createPassiveSellOffer` replace
  `manageOffer` & `createPassiveOffer` in protocol 11 update. For backward
  compatibility, the old operations are still accepted.

### Changed

- Update [stellar-sdk] to 1.0.2.

### Fixed

- Fix a rare bug related to offer deletion.

## 1.4.0 - 2019-04-26

### Added

- Bundle transpiled ES5 code within the package.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-04-19

### Added

- Syntactic sugar to define minTime/maxTime relatively to the current time, in
  minutes. This gets immediately computed into the corresponding UTC date.
  - In queries: `&maxTime=+10`
  - In objects: `{ maxTime: "+10" }`.

### Changed

- Update documentation.

## 1.2.10 - 2019-04-12

### Changed

- Update [stellar-sdk] to 0.15.0.

## 1.2.6 - 2019-02-01
